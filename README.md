# Word_Guesser
guessing game
Create a Java CLI game that allows the user to guess a word randomly picked from a list of words. If the user gets a letter correct and in the correct position. The next output will display the word with the letters they guessed correctly. The program will remember past correct guesses and letter placements. If there are two or more of the same letters guessed, all spots with that character will be filled in.

When you display the unfinished word. Replace all of the unguessed letters with underscores _
